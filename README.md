# React & Jest Testing Practice

This repository is focused on improving skills with **Jest** and **React Testing Library** through hands-on practice. It includes small components, utilities, and sample apps with tests to explore various testing strategies and best practices.

## 🎯 Goals

- Practice unit and integration testing in React
- Learn and apply Jest testing features (mocks, spies, assertions, coverage)
- Test UI behavior with React Testing Library
- Gain experience testing hooks, async functions, and user events

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- React
- Jest
- React Testing Library
- (Optional) Vite or Create React App
